# WGU-C950-Data-Structures-Algorithms-2

This is an algorithm design project written in Python.
The ultimate goal was to create a shortest path algorithm to dynamically schedule package deliveries, with logistical planning to leverage limited resources and close deadlines, as well as to accommodate for changes and unforeseen circumstances with ease. I used a Djikstra's algorithm to dynamically select the next package to deliver by finding the next shortest distance even when addresses are updated mid-route.
The console app is easy to use and navigates comprehensively.
